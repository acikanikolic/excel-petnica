This project aims to create a fully functional Excel-like application with the following features:

Undo/Redo Functionality

Logical Functions

Save/Load Functionality

Mathematical Functions

Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Cell Selection

Unlimited Rows and Columns

Responsibilities

Aleksandar,
your main responsibility is to ensure the application has a robust Undo/Redo functionality. This feature must work seamlessly, allowing users to revert and reapply their actions as needed. In addition to this, you are tasked with implementing the logical functions (such as IF, AND, OR) within the application. These functions must be accurate and efficiently handle various logical operations.


Lara,
your focus is on the Save and Load functionality. Users should be able to save their work and load it at any time without data loss or corruption. Alongside this, you are responsible for creating the mathematical functions (such as SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX). These functions must be precise and performant, enabling users to perform complex calculations easily.

Milica,
your task is to design and develop the Graphical User Interface (GUI). The interface should be user-friendly, intuitive, and visually appealing. Ensure that the layout is clean and that all elements are easily accessible to the user. The GUI should support all the application's features, providing a seamless user experience.

Mila,
you are responsible for the Cell Selection feature, allowing users to select and manipulate individual or multiple cells within the grid. Additionally, you need to implement support for Unlimited Rows and Columns, ensuring that users can add as many rows and columns as needed without performance degradation.

Conclusion
This project requires collaboration, attention to detail, and a commitment to delivering a high-quality product. Each of you has a critical role in making this project a success. Let's work together and ensure that each component is delivered on time and meets the highest standards.
